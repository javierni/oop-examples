# Fundamentals of object orientation

This repository contains code examples in Python preprared for the session about 'Fundamentals of object orientation' inside the block of 'Best programming practices' for the course 'Software development (Software engineering) for researchers'.

For the preparation of these examples we have taken as references the following tutorials:
* [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
* [Python Classes: The Power of Object-Oriented
Programming](https://realpython.com/python-classes/)
